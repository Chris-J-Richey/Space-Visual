####Earth with asteroids effectd by gravity

The Earth with all it's parts along with the skybox was part of an asset from https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/56841. 
The program lagged when the asteroids were spawned more then every half second. 

The program also allows for the viewer to rotate the camera around the Earth using arrow keys, allowing for a full 360 degree view.
